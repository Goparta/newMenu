        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Perfume is a liquid that gives people, things and rooms a good smell. It is made of oils which give off scent to the surrounding air.[1] The odoriferous compounds that make up a perfume can be manufactured synthetically or extracted from plant or animal sources.

            Perfumes were used in the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin. The artificial compounds gave a wider ranger of scents than natural materials.
            
            Perfume smells more when temperature is warmer. So people put it on the neck, wrist and back of the knee, because these parts are warmer. Eau de Cologne is a type of perfume which can be splashed on the body. It is not so concentrated as the usual perfumes.</p>
